## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the postions relative and absolute, even though flexbox is used often it is incredible how we can use these position in order to do really cool things as the pne for the hover feature with the NFT picture.

### Continued development

I will definetely continue learning on how to use the position property and avoid using relative units when possible for responsive content.
